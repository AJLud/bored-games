## The App

Opening the App will direct you to the homepage where you can filter out game reviews using the categories provided.

![categories-demo](public/readme-imgs/categoriesDemo.gif)

The sort bar can currently sort the reviews by Highest Rated, Title and Author name in Ascending and Descending order.

![filters-demo](public/readme-imgs/filtersDemo.gif)

Clicking on the Title of one of the review cards will take you to its own page where you can view the body of the review, Upvote the review and also view any comments that may be attached to it.

Writing you own comment is easy as you can just type what you want in the comment form and it shall be posted just like that, as the default logged in user.
